# Sklearn-Pipeline
I have used the Sklearn pipeline in this project which makes it easy if you want to make predictions on a test dataset, all the transformations which you have applied on a training dataset can be applied automatically with only one line of code
## Pickle
A library is used to export the pipeline which can be later used in the production
# Column Transformer
Transformation techniques that are used, can make multiple and can stack them together with a pipeline
