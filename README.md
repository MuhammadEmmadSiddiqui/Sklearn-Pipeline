# Sklearn-Pipeline
I have used the Sklearn pipeline in this project which makes it easy if you want to make predictions on a test dataset, all the transformations that you have applied on a training dataset can be applied automatically with only one line of code on test data
## Pickle
A library is used to export the pipeline which can be later used in the production
Note: The pickle file is huge for that I am attaching a drive link where you can find the pickle file and run it on any test data

## Column Transformer
Transformation techniques that are used, can make multiple and can stack them together with a pipeline
